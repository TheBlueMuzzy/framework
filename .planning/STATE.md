# Game Framework — State

## ▶ RESUME HERE
Released v0.1.0 — the Game UI kit (kit 0.1.5): 5 styles, ~36 screens, the `game-ui` skill, proven on Roll Better settings. Nothing to host: games copy the kit with `ui-kit/scripts/install-kit.mjs`.
Next: the rest of Roll Better's UI on the kit (Roll Better ROADMAP → Ideas), which will add game-box mode, seat-claim list and 3D-pinned labels here. Or `/roadmap` for the next framework module.

## Where we are
Stage: deliver   Milestone: v0.1 — Game UI kit   Sprint: none (03 done)
Doing: —   Branch: main   Version: 0.1.0
Live: nothing to host (library) — repo https://github.com/TheBlueMuzzy/framework (private), tag v0.1.0

## Key facts
**What this is**
- The Game Framework (BMUZ-PLAN step 2): reusable modules that games copy in with a version stamp; improvements get harvested back. Plan: `~/.claude/config/bmuz/BMUZ-PLAN.md`.
- Modules are copied into games (a framework change never breaks a finished game). UI kit copy goes to a game's `src/ui/kit/`.
**Rules (UI kit)**
- Parts and screens contain no colours, px sizes or fonts — only style names. The style file paints everything.
- All presets have identical setting names + pass contrast (tested). Accessibility floor lives outside presets.
- Web: plain React + plain CSS variables. No Tailwind, no component library (design §6).
- Size budget: core ≤ ~1,000 lines; built screens ≈ 60 lines each (~1,500).
**Run/deploy**
- Default branch `main`. Remote: private GitHub TheBlueMuzzy/framework.
- Dev: npm run dev in ui-kit/ → http://localhost:5180 (--host for phones)
