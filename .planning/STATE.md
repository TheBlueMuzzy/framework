# Game Framework — State

## ▶ RESUME HERE
2026-10-18 — **Sprint 07 started: F69 — fragile jobs become scripts in `~/.claude/config/bmuz/scripts/`.** Tasks: `.planning/SPRINT.md`. (Sprint 06 done: F67 + F74 approved — `archive/sprints/sprint-06.md`.)
- Proof `node ~/.claude/config/bmuz/hooks/test-hooks.mjs` 202/202. Synced to claude-config 1af42a1 — laptop needs `/sync`.
- dev/conformance (pushed) holds F61 + UI kit 0.19.0 credits check + the first look-back (`.planning/archive/lookbacks/v0.9.md`); merges at /deliver. F67's findings for the game sessions are in ROADMAP Ideas (2026-10-18).
- Next: `/develop` — F69 task 1 (install-module.mjs). Later ready: F63 Glyphtender passes · F70 CI · F72 session hygiene · F66 health row; F62 is the Goops session's).

## Where we are
Stage: develop   Milestone: v0.9 — Every game wired the same   Sprint: 07
Doing: F69 — building   Branch: main (+ dev/conformance)   Version: 0.10.0 (main: Dev Kit 0.18.1 · dev/conformance: Dev Kit 0.19.1)
Live: nothing to host (library) — repo https://github.com/TheBlueMuzzy/framework (private), tag v0.2.0

## Key facts
**What this is**
- The Game Framework (BMUZ-PLAN step 2): reusable modules that games copy in with a version stamp; improvements get harvested back. Plan: `~/.claude/config/bmuz/BMUZ-PLAN.md`.
- Modules are copied into games (a framework change never breaks a finished game). UI kit copy goes to a game's `src/ui/kit/`.
**Rules (UI kit)**
- Parts and screens contain no colours, px sizes or fonts — only style names. The style file paints everything.
- All presets have identical setting names + pass contrast (tested). Accessibility floor lives outside presets.
- Web: plain React + plain CSS variables. No Tailwind, no component library (design §6).
- Size budget: core ≤ ~1,000 lines; built screens ≈ 60 lines each (~1,500).
**Run/deploy**
- Default branch `main`. Remote: private GitHub TheBlueMuzzy/framework.
- Dev: npm run dev in ui-kit/ → http://localhost:5180 (--host for phones)
- Dev Kit: `devkit/` — `npm test`; install with `node devkit/scripts/install-devkit.mjs <game>` (--dry-run first on updates). Game-side check: `npm run check:devkit`.

- 2026-09-28 — Sprint 01 done: F01 parts + style engine, F02 5 styles, F03 screen stack (Back/Esc, inert, style transitions); 74 tests. Muzzy approved all three.
- 2026-09-28 — Project created; UI kit researched (skill review + kit inventory + platforms) and designed; Muzzy approved 5 presets, the repo, and the Built list.
